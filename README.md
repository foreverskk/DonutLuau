# DonutLuau

An attempt at remaking the famous donut.c in Roblox Luau.

# How to use?
> Create a text label, scale it, add a LocalScript and paste the code.
> Though... I don't know why anyone would even use this anyway...

[!NOTE]
> The code is ALMOST donut shaped, it took longer to shape it into a donut than it took
> to write it... Yes!
